== Solution Strategy

=== Technology Decisions

In order to develop the application and adhere to the constraints, we selected the following technologies:

- ReactJS: JavaScript library that streamlines the development of graphical interfaces for web applications.
- TypeScript: Extension of JavaScript, bolstering it with type support for improved development.
- GitHub: Platform offering remote repository services for project development, task management, and version control.
- MongoDB: A non-linear database selected to oversee storage of diverse application contents, with each microservice possessing its dedicated database.
- NodeJS: Facilitates efficient management of asynchronous events, notably beneficial for scalable network applications and database administration.
- Docker: Employed for seamless deployment of the application environment.

=== Top-level Decomposition

==== Diagramming tools

We will use PlantUML and UMLet for creating the documentation's diagrams.

=== Organizational Decisions

We've established the following organizational guidelines:

- *Language*: Adhering to international standards, the project, encompassing code and documentation, will be developed in English as the primary language.
- *Issues:* All deliberations will be documented as issues on GitHub.
- *GitHub Projects:* Employing this tool, we'll plan the application's development process, utilizing GitHub's integrated features for efficient project management in accordance with AGILE methodology.
