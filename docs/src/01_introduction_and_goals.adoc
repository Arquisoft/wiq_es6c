== Introduction and Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****

=== Requirements Overview

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

The WIQ web application allows users to play a game similar to the one of Saber y Ganar quiz show. This game consists on answering a number of questions with different types and subjects obtaining  a prize for each question well answered. Game´s questions are automatically generated from data available in Wikidata (https://www.wikidata.org/).

* The system will have at least a web front-end which will be available and accessible through the web.
* Users will be able to register with the system and obtain the historical data from their participation: number of games, questions passed and failed, times, etc.
* Questions will be automatically generated from data available in Wikidata.
* Questions have to be answered before some specific time.
* Each question will have one right answer and several incorrect ones or "decoy answers". Both the right answer and the decoy ones should be automatically generated.
* The system will give access to the information about the users through an API.
* The system will give access to information about the generated questions through an API.


=== Quality Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
****
.Quality goals ordered by priority (from most to least important)
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Quality Goal|Description
| _Learnability_ | Any user must be able to use the app with ease. The interface must remind the user to the one in  Saber y Ganar quiz show.
| _Satisfaction_ | Users will not get repeated questions in at least a hundred questions.
| _Modularity_ | The application will be divided in modules so that a change on one component has minimal impact on other components.
| _Testability_ | The application should be able to go through different test and complete them successfully.
| _Time behaviour_ | Users will not have to wait more than 500ms to get a new question.

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
