== Quality Requirements


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

****

To describe the quality requirements that the game will have, we will use quality scenarios. Quality scenarios describe 
the action to be performed by the user or the system (stimulus) in order to generate a response to the interaction.

=== Quality Tree

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

=== Quality Scenarios

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.

.Form
Tabular or free form text.

Quality scenarios, also known as use cases, are detailed descriptions of situations in which a user interacts with 
a system and describe the expected outcomes along with the conditions of the environment in which the interaction 
occurs.

|Quality goal
|Motivation
|Usage Scenarios
|Priority

|Usability
|The ease of interaction with the user should be enhanced through intuitive and simple interfaces to enhance the user experience. 
|Users will be able to understand how the game works thanks to the clarity of its rules and ease of navigation.
|High

|Diversity
|The questions provided by the application will be of various topics.
|The user must correctly answer questions on different topics. This will improve the user experience and maintain the interest of the participants.
|High

|Integrity
|The game must be played without errors.
|The answer determined as correct for each question by the system shall be the one that is actually correct.
|Medium

|Interactivity
|The user must answer a series of questions in which the user must select the correct answer in each case.
|For each of the questions, the user must select the correct answer from those provided by the system.
|Medium

|Privacy
|In order to be able to play, the user must log in to the application.
|Only the user who created/owns the account will have access to it (unless he/she gives someone else his/her credentials).
